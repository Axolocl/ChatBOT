# ChatBOT
Beginner ChatBOT (pun intended)


This is a simple Python chatbot that can learn new answers to questions based on user input. It's one of my beginner projects that I created to understand how chatbots work and how data is stored in JSON files.
Features

    The bot starts with a few pre-defined questions and answers.
    If the bot doesn’t know the answer to a question, you can teach it!
    It remembers new answers by saving them to a JSON file.

Why I Built This

I’ve been programming for less than 6 months, and this chatbot project was a great way for me to practice:

    Working with files in Python (reading from and writing to JSON).
    Using string matching to find the closest answer to a user’s question.
    Building a simple interaction loop that can run until you type "quit."
